# Resto Finder WebApp

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

#### Thanks for checking out this repo [restaurant-finder](https://github.com/beharavenkatasatyaprasad/restaurant-finder/)

## The Webapp

The app is integrated by using the Zomato Api's `/geolocation` Endpoint.

I have used HTML,CSS & JavaScript (Jquery,DOM) to develop the Webapp.

#### Users are able to:

##### - Give access to give access to get their geolocation

##### - Access all the Restarants data in nearby location.
