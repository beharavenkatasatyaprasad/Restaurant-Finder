## Resto Finder WebApp

##### The app is integrated by using the Zomato Api's `/geolocation` Endpoint.

##### I have used HTML,CSS & JavaScript (Jquery,DOM) to develop the Webapp.

### Users are able to:

##### - Give access to give access to get their geolocation

##### - Access all the Restaurants data in nearby location.
